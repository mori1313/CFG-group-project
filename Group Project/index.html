        <h4>Engineering has an image problem</h4>
        <img class="image1" src="https://oliver-dev.s3.amazonaws.com/thumbs/500x500/049c6445-1d83-4f94-a639-3335ab1cfed6.png" alt="35/100 women in STEM">
        <p>According to EngineerUK, only 12% of engineers are women, and only 8% come from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds. There is a typical image of what an engineering should look like, and it means that a lot of people, schoolchildren especially, are not considering STEM or engineering as a career option for them.</p>

        <h5>Diversity benefits industry</h5>
        <img class="image2" src="https://www.theengineer.co.uk/content/uploads/2018/10/BossTraining3.jpg" alt="engineers at work">
        <p>As well as being a worthy goal in and of itself, inclusion brings tangible benefits for companies. In a recent study of 600 companies, inclusive teams made decisions twice as fast and required half the number of meetings. Furthermore, diverse team decisions delivered 60% better results.</p>

        <h6>How we are promoting inclusion</h6>
        <img class="image3" src="https://zzjyl3lhxs3eyvm92cs1kx1a-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1_demcGr62Xqhxn8TrVJyvww-1000x576.png" alt="Inclusion">
        <p>In addition to more inclusive hiring practices, we believe that it is vital that young people aspire to roles in engineering. Therefore we deliver engineering workshops in schools to demonstrate the wide range of transferable skills needed in the industry, as well as organising talks with leading female engineers in the field.</p>
